<h3>Money Heist</h3>
<p>This is one of my favourite web series in the Netflix. I just became die-hard fan of this series. Especially i need to mentioned one character in that series,<b>Professor!</b>i just love him the way he perform the character and planning the heist. And the best thing is i have watched whole series five or more times because of the characters and the emotion which is drawn so beautiful.</p>

<h3>Stranger Things</h3>
<p>I like the way Duffer Brothers creating this kind of world with full of monsters and i just loved it. Especially the kids they are just amazing and i need to mention another two guys <b>Steve</b> and <b>Hopper</b> the way both of them were performed absolutely outstanding.But i like Steve character more. Also i need to tell about EL character in this series. she is so strange girl and she has some strange power's which is to kill the monsters.</p>

<h3>K.G.F</h3>
<p>This is the film i liked the most compared to any other film that i have watched till now. It contains 2 parts of the film. I love the film because of <b>Bgm</b> and <b>Mother-son</b> bonding which is so emotional. And also Rocky bhai character with full of violence and i just loved it.
